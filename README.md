# CodeSamples

I am trying to create a bunch of samples to help myself to reuse my own code. I am using my own repositories a lot to do a "how did I do that before" search. 

## Sample projects

| Title | |
|--|--|
| [Console With appsettings](./ConsoleApps/ConsoleWithAppConfig) | A console application with an appsettings, ioptions and a service provider |
| [Console With User Secrets](./ConsoleApps/ConsoleWithUserSecrets) | A console application with an appsettings, ioptions and a service provider and user secrets |
| [Unit testing with test data](./UnitTesting/TestData) | A xunit test project with different types of test data (Inline, TestClass, MemberData) |
